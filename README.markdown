### Manual Setup

Step 1: Download Alpaca!

Using your console, to get it from git execute the following command in the root of your development environment:

 * Using Git 1.6.5 or newer version:

	`$ git clone --recursive git://github.com/icyleaf/alpaca.git`

 * Using older git verions:

	`$ git clone git://github.com/icyleaf/alpaca.git`

Next, add whatever submodules alpaca need, they must be initialized and update (go to `alpaca` path):
	
	$ cd alpaca
	$ git submodule update --init

One more thing, alpaca require `twig-php` template engine. Then, go to path `core/modules/twig`, it also must be initialized and update:

	$ cd core/modules/twig
	$ git submodule update --init
	
That's all there is to it.

Step 2: Cownfiguration of Database

Edit `application/config/database.php` with the correct information.

> `$development` variable is development environment in local.

> `$production` variable is production environment online.

Step 3: Import SQL

Run the SQL found in `dump/install.sql`.

Step 4: Configuration of Alpaca

Open `core/bootstrap.php` and make the following changes:

* Set the default [timezone](http://php.net/timezones) for your application

Make sure the `cache` and `logs` directories are world writable with `chmod {cache,logs} 0777`

> Depending on your platform, the installation's subdirs may have lost their permissions thanks to zip extraction. Chmod them all to 755 by running `find . -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \;` from the root of your Alpaca installation.

**Never need to set `base_url`, it could be detected from your browser.**
